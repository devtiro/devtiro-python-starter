# Devtiro Python Starter
An opinionated starter for quickly getting Python projects up and running.

## Toolchain
This is the sequence of tools run on `make build`:

#### 1. Format: `black`
The [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter automatically formats Python
code using an opinionated, but largely PEP8 compliant style.

Why bother? ðŸ¤· Because life is too short to worry about code style minutiae for every
single project.

Plus the code looks pretty good after formatting ðŸ™Œ.

Applied to project and test code.

Can be run independently using using `make format`.

#### 2. Lint: `flake8`
The tool "flake8" enforces PEP8 compliant code style across the codebase. Stray away
from PEP8 and the build will fail ðŸ’¥.

To be [compatible with Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/using_black_with_other_tools.html#flake8)
the line length and a few other tweaks have been placed in the `.flake8` configuration
file.

Can also be run through `make lint`.

#### 3. Security Check Code: `bandit`
The tool `bandit` scans the project code to find common security issues.

If a common security issue is found, then the build will fail ðŸ’¥.

Can also be run through `make security`.

#### Tests: `pytest`
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests. That's exactly what
we want ðŸŽ‰.

The plugin [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) is used to generate test
reports. There's a variable `min_test_cov` in the Makefile which is current set to
`85`(%).

If a test fails or the test coverage drops below the value of `min_test_cov`, then the
build will fail ðŸ’¥.

Can also be run through `make test`.
